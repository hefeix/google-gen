(circular) Glossary:

Term - Either a constant, wildcard or variable.   Terms are represented 
     internally by integers and externally by strings.  

  Constant - These are the basic building blocks of our language, similar to
     "words" in english.  Most have no pre-loaded semantics.  Constants
     are represented by non-negative integers, or by non-empty strings
     which don't start with '*'.  
  Wildcard - There is one wildcard.  It represents any constant.  It is 
     represented by the integer -1, or by the string "*".
  Variable - There are infinitely variables called Variable(x) where x is
     a non-negative integer.  A variable can represent any constant, but within
     a tuple or pattern (see below), two instances of the same variable must
     represent the same constant.  Variable(x) is represented as the integer
     -2-x, or as the string "*<x>" where <x> is the decimal ascii representation
     of x.  For example, Variable(3) would be represented as -5 or as "*3".
     
Tuple - An ordered set of terms.
      Constant Tuple - May only have constants
      Wildcard Tuple - May have only constants and Wildcards.
      	       	       Matches constant tuple, where each wildcard can match 
		       any constant.  There is no concept of a substitution. 
      Variable Tuple - May have only constants and Variables.
      	       	       Matches a constat tuple according to a substitution of
		       constants for variables (two instances of the same
		       variable must match the same constant).

Pattern - A vector of variable tuples.  It matches a vector of constant tuples.
	A match must respect order and respect a single substitution.
	(we may at some point consider sets of tuples instead of vectors of 
	tuples).  

Substitution - A mapping of terms to terms.
