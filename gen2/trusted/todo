Delay stuff:
 -Insert an infinitessimal delay in the on statement. 
 -Enable -inf and inf bit sequences and bit sequences of length >31

New Statements/expressions
 MapReduce Expression
 ForEach statement
 can the two be combined ?


Figure out how to have multi-letter variable names. 

Now:

Port previous learning algorithms.

L8r:

what if a bit sequence has length >31?  

Give the executor/fixer options (maybe a strategy) so that it can have variations in strategy.
Write a random executor.



Disallow MakeChangesPermanent in batch mode, since the delayed notifications may point to deleted objects.
