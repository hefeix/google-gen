Profiling/Optimizing ideas:

Track the number of each named type that have ever been created. 
Mode where the number of single link violations are tracked, instead of creating them.  
Look at allocations in the changelist.  


Now:

Profile
Track complexity costs.
Port previous learning algorithms.

L8r:

Give the executor/fixer options (maybe a strategy) so that it can have variations in strategy.
Write a random executor.
