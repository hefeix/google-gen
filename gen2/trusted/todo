immediately:

   fix bug in set chooser ll computation
   choose how to encode variable constants (x)
   choose how to encode tuples
   figure out a display for the model's total likelihood that makes sense

Now:

Track complexity costs.
Port previous learning algorithms.

L8r:

Give the executor/fixer options (maybe a strategy) so that it can have variations in strategy.
Write a random executor.



Disallow MakeChangesPermanent in batch mode, since the delayed notifications may point to deleted objects.
