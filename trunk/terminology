(circular) Glossary:

Term - represented by an integer or a string.  Can be one of
     Constant - (a positive integer) (any string not starting with '*' or '$')
     Wildcard - (0) ("*")
     Variable - (negative integer)("$<-x>")
     

Tuple - An ordered set of terms.
      Constant Tuple - May only have constants
      Wildcard Tuple - May have only constants and Wildcards.
      	       	       Matches constant tuple, where each wildcard can match 
		       any constant.  There is no concept of a substitution. 
      Variable Tuple - May have only constants and Variables.
      	       	       Matches a constat tuple according to a substitution of
		       constants for variables (two instances of the same
		       variable must match the same constant).

Pattern - A vector of variable tuples.  It matches a vector of constant tuples.
	A match must respect order and respect a single substitution.
	(we may at some point consider sets of tuples instead of vectors of 
	tuples).  

Substitution - A mapping of terms to terms.
