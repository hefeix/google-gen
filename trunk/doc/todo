easy stuff:

N: Discretize all the ln_likelihoods

N: Clear the model by reverting the entire changelist

N: resurrect commented out tactics

N: Make sure everything is kosher with likelihood tracking.

G: Make the webserver convenient



hard/nebulous stuff:

N: keep track of computational complexity costs.

N: figure out a faster way to detect circular causation

N: track properties of constants (patterns for which they satisfy something).  track sets of terms for which we want to explain something.  Put it all together.

N: Keep an index of relationships between objects/pairs of objects.  Use it to find distant relationships between objects in coming up with rules.




tactics: 


N: given a tuple explain it as best possible using an existing rule (to replace the current explanation).

N: given a set of tuples, explain them as best possible, either by adding a new rule or using an old one.  

N: alter causation for a rule ( move tuples between precondition and result)

N: find one tuple taking part in multiple rules.  Combine the rules.

N: generalize a rule by turning two or more literals into variables and adding clauses to indicate their relaitonship.
