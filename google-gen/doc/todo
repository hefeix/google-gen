easy stuff:

N: Discretize all the ln_likelihoods

N: Make sure everything is kosher with likelihood tracking.

G: Make the webserver convenient


medium stuff:

Incorporate sampling into rule screening.

Factoring rules 
(with or without substituting variables for constants)

Adding Tuples to the left hand side of a rule for incerased accuracy.
(by adding a tuple to the RHS of this or another rule)
(by adding any tuple)

Keep an index between constants and (Rule,variable) pairs.
(to be used in the accuracy stuff above)
(maybe even pairs/triples of constants)


hard/nebulous stuff:

N: keep track of computational complexity costs.

N: figure out a faster way to detect circular causation

N: track properties of constants (patterns for which they satisfy something).  track sets of terms for which we want to explain something.  Put it all together.

N: Keep an index of relationships between objects/pairs of objects.  Use it to find distant relationships between objects in coming up with rules.




tactics: 


N: given a tuple explain it as best possible using an existing rule (to replace the current explanation).

N: given a set of tuples, explain them as best possible, either by adding a new rule or using an old one.  

N: alter causation for a rule ( move tuples between precondition and result)

N: find one tuple taking part in multiple rules.  Combine the rules.

N: generalize a rule by turning two or more literals into variables and adding clauses to indicate their relaitonship.
