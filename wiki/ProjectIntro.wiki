== What's this project all about? ==
The time has come to build a system that can use unlabeled data to deduce the relationships between objects with no human input or labelling.   The system should be able to discover hidden relationships, as well as hypothesize new types of relationships and hidden rules of its own invention.   
== How can the computer know what is right without human-labeled data? ==
The same way scientists have been doing it for hundreds of years.  It's called Occham's Razor.  The simplest (or most likely) explanation is generally the best, and even though we can't know that it's true, it is quite useful for predicting new and unobserved data.
== Isn't this a very ambitious project? ==
Yes.
== Who are you? ==
We are a couple of computer scientists who have built some big (but not as general-purpose) machine learning systems at [http://google.com Google] (which is a very fun place to  [http://google.com/jobs work]). Here's our [http://code.google.com/p/google-gen/wiki/Contact Contact Info].
== Why is this project open source? ==
Because it is a very ambitious project.  Once we get our first version out, we hope to get some other people involved.  Also, we want other people to be able to write applications based on this framework.
